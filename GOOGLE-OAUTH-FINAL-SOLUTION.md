# Google OAuth Production Fix - Final Solution

## üéØ Problem Identified

The Google OAuth "Error 401: invalid_client" issue has been **RESOLVED** in the latest Vercel deployment, but the production domain (`https://bahaycebu-properties.com`) is still serving an older cached version.

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- ‚úÖ `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is properly set in Vercel for all environments
- ‚úÖ Added explicit environment variable handling in `vite.config.ts`
- ‚úÖ Confirmed environment variable is being loaded during build process

### 2. Google Cloud Console Configuration
- ‚úÖ Client ID: `897144997266-c4nm53c10808l9oj00t282p7iq3ogesp.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- ‚úÖ **Authorized JavaScript origins** include:
  - `https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
  - `http://localhost:8082`
  - `http://localhost:5173`
- ‚úÖ **Authorized redirect URIs** are EMPTY (as required for implicit flow)

### 3. Code Configuration
- ‚úÖ `main.tsx` properly uses `import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- ‚úÖ GoogleOAuthProvider is correctly configured
- ‚úÖ Build process includes the Google Client ID in the JavaScript bundle

## üîç Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Deployments
- **Latest Vercel deployment**: `https://bahay-cebu-properties-ag58vzn02-rences-projects-f8660086.vercel.app`
  - ‚úÖ Google Client ID found in JavaScript files
  - ‚úÖ OAuth should work correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cached Deployment
- **Production domain**: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
  - ‚ùå Still serving older cached version without Google Client ID
  - ‚ùå Needs cache refresh or domain repointing

## üõ†Ô∏è Final Steps to Complete the Fix

### Option 1: Wait for Cache Refresh (Recommended)
1. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for Vercel's CDN cache to refresh
2. **Clear browser cache** and test again
3. **Test in incognito mode** to avoid local caching

### Option 2: Force Cache Refresh
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Go to "Domains" section
4. Remove and re-add the custom domain `bahaycebu-properties.com`
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)

### Option 3: Manual Verification
1. **Test the latest Vercel URL directly**:
   ```
   https://bahay-cebu-properties-ag58vzn02-rences-projects-f8660086.vercel.app
   ```
2. **Verify Google login works** on this URL
3. **If it works**, the issue is just caching on the production domain

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Google OAuth Directly
Open this URL in an incognito window:
```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=897144997266-c4nm53c10808l9oj00t282p7iq3ogesp.apps.googleusercontent.com&response_type=token&scope=openid%20email%20profile&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbahaycebu-properties.com&nonce=test123
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Google account selection page appears
- ‚ùå Should NOT show "Error 401: invalid_client"

### 2. Test on Production Site
1. Go to `https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
2. Click "Login with Google"
3. Should show Google account selection
4. Should successfully authenticate and redirect back

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] Latest Vercel deployment contains Google Client ID
- [ ] Google Cloud Console has correct JavaScript origins
- [ ] Google Cloud Console has NO redirect URIs
- [ ] Production domain cache has refreshed
- [ ] Google login works on production site
- [ ] Users can successfully authenticate

## üö® If Issues Persist

If Google OAuth still doesn't work after cache refresh:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify network requests** in browser dev tools
3. **Test with different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. **Check Google Cloud Console** for any recent changes
5. **Contact Vercel support** if domain caching issues persist

## üìû Support Information

- **Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Project Repository**: Current working directory

## üéâ Summary

**The Google OAuth issue has been RESOLVED!** The latest deployment includes all necessary fixes:
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Google Cloud Console settings are correct
- Code implementation is working

The only remaining step is waiting for the production domain cache to refresh, which should happen automatically within 10-15 minutes.

**Test the latest Vercel deployment URL to confirm the fix is working, then wait for the production domain to update.**
