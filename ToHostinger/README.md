- ✅ **GET** `/api/properties` - Get all properties
- ✅ **GET** `/api/properties/{id}` - Get property by ID
- ✅ **PUT** `/api/properties/{id}` - Update property
- ✅ **DELETE** `/api/properties/{id}` - Delete property

- ✅ **POST** `/api/agents` - Create new agent
- ✅ **GET** `/api/agents` - Get all agents
- ✅ **GET** `/api/agents/{id}` - Get agent by ID
- ✅ **PUT** `/api/agents/{id}` - Update agent

### New JSON Fields Added
All property endpoints now support these additional fields:
- `unitTypeDetails` (array)
- `locationAccessibility` (object)
- `featuresAmenities` (object)
- `lifestyleCommunity` (object)
- `additionalInformation` (object)

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure your production environment has these variables configured:
```
DB_HOST=153.92.15.81
DB_USER=u547531148_bahaycebu_admi
DB_PASSWORD=Bahaycebu123
DB_NAME=u547531148_bahaycebu_db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Steps

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Production Files Updated (Latest Build)
The frontend files in this folder have been updated with the latest fixes for:
- Agent image display issues with fallback handling
- **FIXED: Description field length limitation** - Database schema updated from VARCHAR(191) to TEXT to support long descriptions
- Description truncation improvements (300 character limit)
- Fast delete confirmations with visual feedback
- Enhanced error handling and validation

### Deploy to Production:
1. **Apply Database Migration**: The description field length has been fixed. If you're experiencing truncation issues, apply this SQL to your database:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE `Agent` MODIFY COLUMN `description` TEXT NOT NULL;
   ```

2. **Upload Frontend Files**: Upload all contents of `frontend/` folder to `public_html/` (⚠️ This will overwrite existing files)
3. **Upload API Files**: Use Hostinger File Manager to upload the `api/` folder contents to `public_html/api/`
4. **Upload Backend Server**: Upload `deployment-package/backend-api.js` to your Node.js application directory
5. **Restart Services**: Restart your Node.js application if applicable
6. **Test Endpoints**: Test the API at `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/properties`
7. **Verify Fixes**: Test the admin dashboard at `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/admin` to confirm all fixes are working

## Testing

After deployment, you can test the endpoints:

### Property Endpoints
- GET: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/properties`
- POST: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/properties` (with JSON body)
- PUT: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/properties/{id}` (with JSON body)
- DELETE: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/properties/{id}`

### Agent Endpoints
- GET: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/agents`
- POST: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/agents` (with JSON body)
- PUT: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/agents/{id}` (with JSON body)
- DELETE: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com/api/agents/{id}`

## Notes

- All files have been updated to include the missing JSON fields that were causing database constraint errors
- The database connection file (`_db.js`) includes the correct production database credentials
- CORS headers are configured for `https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
- **IMPORTANT**: Fixed CORS issue for DELETE agent requests - added OPTIONS method handling to `agents/[id].js`
- Error handling and validation are included in all endpoints
