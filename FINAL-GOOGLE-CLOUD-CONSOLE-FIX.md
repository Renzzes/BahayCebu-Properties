# üö® FINAL FIX: Google Cloud Console OAuth Configuration

## Current Issue: Error 401: invalid_client

**Root Cause**: The Google Cloud Console OAuth client configuration doesn't match your production domain and still has redirect URIs that conflict with the implicit OAuth flow.

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console
1. **Go to**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. **Login** with your Google account
3. **Select** your project

### Step 2: Find Your OAuth Client
**Look for this Client ID:**
```
897144997266-c4nm53c10808l9oj00t282p7iq3ogesp.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### Step 3: Edit OAuth Client Configuration
1. **Click** on the client ID name to edit
2. **Update** the configuration as follows:

**CURRENT WRONG Configuration:**
```
‚ùå Authorized JavaScript origins:
  ‚Ä¢ Missing your actual domain: https://bahaycebu-properties.com
  ‚Ä¢ http://localhost:8082

‚ùå Authorized redirect URIs:
  ‚Ä¢ https://bahaycebu-properties.com/auth/google/callback
  ‚Ä¢ https://api.bahaycebu-properties.com/auth/google/callback
  ‚Ä¢ Any other redirect URIs
```

**CORRECT Configuration:**
```
‚úÖ Authorized JavaScript origins:
  ‚Ä¢ https://bahaycebu-properties.com (your Hostinger domain)
  ‚Ä¢ http://localhost:8082
  ‚Ä¢ http://localhost:5173

‚úÖ Authorized redirect URIs:
  (COMPLETELY EMPTY - Delete all entries)
```

### Step 4: Update JavaScript Origins
1. **Ensure** your domain is present: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
2. **Add** if missing: `https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
3. **Keep** localhost entries for development: `http://localhost:8082` and `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 5: Remove ALL Redirect URIs
1. **Click** the ‚ùå button next to each redirect URI
2. **Delete** ALL entries until section is empty
3. **This is critical** - implicit flow doesn't use redirect URIs

### Step 6: Save Changes
1. **Click** "SAVE" button
2. **Wait** for confirmation message
3. **Wait** 5-10 minutes for Google to propagate changes

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### After Making Changes:
1. **Wait** 10 minutes for propagation
2. **Clear** browser cache completely
3. **Open** incognito/private window
4. **Visit**: https://bahaycebu-properties.com
5. **Click** "Sign in with Google"
6. **Test** with your Google account

### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Google login popup opens
- ‚úÖ No "Error 401: invalid_client"
- ‚úÖ Successful authentication
- ‚úÖ User logged into application

## üîß Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Domain Configuration**: Your production app is on https://bahaycebu-properties.com (Hostinger), Google Console must have this exact domain
2. **Redirect URI Conflict**: Implicit flow doesn't use redirect URIs, but they were configured causing validation errors
3. **JavaScript Origins**: Must match your exact Hostinger domain for security validation

## üìã Verification Checklist

**Before testing, confirm:**
- [ ] Ensured JavaScript origins includes https://bahaycebu-properties.com
- [ ] Added localhost entries for development (8082, 5173)
- [ ] Deleted ALL redirect URIs (section is empty)
- [ ] Clicked "SAVE" in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Waited 10 minutes for propagation
- [ ] Cleared browser cache
- [ ] Testing in incognito mode
