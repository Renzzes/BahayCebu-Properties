# URGENT: Production CORS Fix Required

## Current Status
❌ **PRODUCTION IS BROKEN** - CORS errors preventing agent deletion

## Problem Confirmed
- Production API at `https://api.bahaycebu-properties.com` returns "Method not allowed" for OPTIONS requests
- Frontend at `https://bahaycebu-properties.com` cannot delete agents due to CORS policy
- The CORS fix has NOT been deployed to production

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### CLARIFICATION: API Setup
- ✅ **Main domain** (`bahaycebu-properties.com`) = Hostinger
- ❌ **API subdomain** (`api.bahaycebu-properties.com`) = Vercel (causing CORS issues)

### SOLUTION OPTIONS:

## Option 1: Fix CORS on Vercel (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Update Vercel API Configuration**
   - In your Vercel project, ensure `vercel.json` includes proper CORS headers
   - Redeploy the API on Vercel with CORS fix

2. **Alternative: Use Hostinger for Static Files Only**
   - Note: Hostinger shared hosting doesn't support Node.js/npm
   - You would need VPS hosting for Node.js applications
   - Current shared hosting only supports PHP, HTML, CSS, JS

## Option 2: Upgrade Hosting (If Budget Allows)

1. **Upgrade to VPS/Cloud Hosting**
   - Hostinger VPS plans support Node.js
   - Then follow original deployment steps

2. **Keep Current Setup & Fix CORS**
   - Fix CORS headers in Vercel deployment
   - Update environment variables
   - Redeploy frontend

## Files Ready for Upload
✅ Fixed files are in: `deployment-package/`
- `backend-api.js` (contains CORS fix)
- `package.json`
- `start-api.js`

## Test After Fix
1. Visit: https://bahaycebu-properties.com/admin-login
2. Try deleting an agent
3. Should work without CORS errors

## Alternative: Move API to Main Domain
If subdomain access is difficult:
1. Upload `deployment-package/` contents to `public_html/api/`
2. Update Vercel env: `VITE_API_URL=https://bahaycebu-properties.com`
3. Redeploy frontend
